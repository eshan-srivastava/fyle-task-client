# Github Repo View - Assignment
## Client side (Frontend - plain HTML CSS JS)

#### Requirements Implemented
1. **User Data** is shown upon entering of a username, for invalid usernames an error is shown
2. **Server sends only necessary data** for displaying purposes thus reducing download size on client side 
3. Users have the option to navigate using either **dropdown menu having direct page numbers or buttons**. Buttons are disabled internally when valid pages don't exist (for ex last page).
4. Topics and description are displayed when they are not null.
5. Users have the option to change **how many repositories are displayed on 1 page** and the navigation auto-adjusts with it.

*Since this is for non-production purposes, API has been hardcoded for localhost deployment*

#### Steps to run this
1. Run index.html in browser or using any liveserver platform
